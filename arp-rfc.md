## Why This RFC Exists

For a non-technical reader, ARP is a shared switchboard for human and agent work. It exists so one workspace can:

- connect people from chat, terminal, and IDE clients
- connect agents working on the same task
- route messages, approvals, and results in one place
- keep audit history and workspace lifecycle under one control plane
- link trusted workspaces together when work must cross boundaries

Without ARP, the current protocol stack solves individual links such as editor-to-agent or agent-to-tool communication, but not the shared workspace fabric around them. This RFC defines that missing layer.

```
 [People]
    |
 [Chat / CLI / IDE]
    |
 [Workspace Room] ---------------- trusted links ---------------- [Other Workspaces]
    | \
    |  +--> [Agent Sidecars + Agents]
    |  +--> [Files / Context / Resources]
    |
    +--> [Audit Log]

 [Control Plane] -------------------------------> [Workspace Room]
 [Control Plane] -------------------------------> [Create / Pause / Resume / Route]
```

## High-Level Room View

At runtime, ARP centers work around a Room. Humans and bridges connect to the Room, the Control Plane and RLM manage lifecycle around it, and every agent is represented through a 1:1 attached sidecar. The sidecar speaks ASP, receives delegated requests plus signed mandates, and invokes or polls the passive agent locally.

```
 [Human User] ------------------------------------------\
 [Human Channel] -- bridge session ---------------------+--> [Workspace Room] --> [Audit Log]
 [Peer Room / Federated Link] -- trusted ASP link -----/

 [Control Plane] -- routing + policy + lifecycle -----> [Workspace Room]
 [Control Plane] -- spawn / suspend / resume ---------> [Runtime Lifecycle Manager]

 [Workspace Room] -- delegated text + signed mandate -> [Sidecar: agent1] -- invoke / poll -> [Passive Agent 1]
 [Workspace Room] -- delegated text + signed mandate -> [Sidecar: agent2] -- invoke / poll -> [Passive Agent 2]

 [Runtime Lifecycle Manager] -- spawns + resumes -----> [Sidecar: agent1]
 [Runtime Lifecycle Manager] -- spawns + resumes -----> [Sidecar: agent2]

```

## Abstract

This document specifies the Agent Relay Protocol (ARP), a switching fabric and workspace infrastructure for autonomous agent meshes. ARP defines how agents, humans, and client bridges connect to Workspaces; how Rooms relay messages between participants; how a Control Plane manages topology, workspace lifecycle, and routing state; and how inter-Room communication enables multi-hop meshes.

ARP operates at the **communication and infrastructure layer** — below the semantics of agent collaboration (A2A) and above the mechanics of tool access (MCP) and editor integration (ACP). It provides the managed topology, workspace lifecycle, and message routing that these protocols do not address.

ARP is to agent meshes what a telephone switching network is to voice communication: a universal, topology-agnostic fabric that routes messages between participants without knowledge of their content.

## 1. Problem Statement

AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent, multi-human systems. Several protocols have emerged to address different layers of the agentic stack, most now maturing under open governance. However, none define a **switching fabric** — a managed infrastructure where agents and humans are organized into workspaces, connected by routable topology, with lifecycle management, audit, and multi-client access.

### 1.1 Protocol Landscape (March 2026)

| Protocol | Governed By | Scope | What It Solves |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | AAIF / Linux Foundation (Anthropic, Nov 2024) | Agent ↔ Tools/Data | Standardized access to external tools, data sources, and resources via JSON-RPC. 10,000+ published servers, 97M+ monthly SDK downloads. |
| **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol) | Zed Industries + JetBrains | Editor ↔ Agent | Editor-to-coding-agent communication via JSON-RPC over stdio. Analogous to LSP for AI agents. Session management, streaming, file system access, terminal operations. |
| **A2A** (Agent2Agent Protocol) | Linux Foundation (Google, Apr 2025; v0.3 Jul 2025) | Agent ↔ Agent | Peer-to-peer agent collaboration via HTTP/SSE/JSON-RPC/gRPC. Agent Cards for capability discovery, task lifecycle, multimodal negotiation. 150+ supporting organizations. |
| **AGENTS.md** | AAIF / Linux Foundation (OpenAI, Aug 2025) | Agent ↔ Repository | Project-specific instructions for coding agents. 60,000+ open-source projects. |

### 1.2 The Gap

None of these protocols address:

- **Managed topology** — how agents are grouped into workspaces with shared environments, routed across Rooms, connected via a control plane
- **Multi-client access** — how the same workspace is accessed simultaneously from a terminal, a messaging app, and an IDE
- **Workspace lifecycle** — how a collaborative unit (code + agent + humans) is created, suspended, resumed, and audited
- **Multi-hop relay** — how a message traverses multiple Rooms without hardcoded addressing
- **Broadcast and fan-out** — how an agent's response reaches all human participants in a workspace

MCP connects agents to tools. ACP connects editors to agents. A2A enables agent-to-agent collaboration. **ARP provides the infrastructure mesh beneath all of them.**

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Agent

An agent is a logical autonomous worker addressed by name within the mesh; resolution is handled by the Room and Control Plane.

In ARP v1, every agent participates through a **1:1 attached sidecar** that connects to the Room, invokes or polls the agent through a local adapter, and emits ASP messages on the agent's behalf. The sidecar is an implementation detail of the agent runtime and is not exposed to users as a separate participant identity.

An agent is instantiated with a **harness** — a configuration bundle specifying the model, provider, tools, skills, and behavioral constraints. The harness is opaque to the protocol; ARP treats it as metadata stored in the Control Plane and passed to the Runtime Lifecycle Manager at spawn time.

Agents may use ACP, MCP, A2A, or other local execution interfaces through their sidecar/runtime adapter. ARP is concerned only with routing, policy, and workspace topology, not with how the agent executes its local work.

### 2.1.1 Agent Sidecar

An agent sidecar is a child transport adapter managed alongside exactly one agent by the RLM or workspace runtime. The sidecar:

- Terminates ASP on behalf of its parent agent
- Translates between ASP and the agent's local interface (ACP, stdio, HTTP, SDK, queue, or similar)
- Invokes or polls the agent and returns replies, tool proposals, approvals, and failures
- Verifies received signed mandates and enforces them locally on delegated requests

Agents do not send unsolicited ASP protocol messages in v1. They reply only when invoked or polled by their sidecar.

### 2.2 Room

A Room is a process or pod that acts as a **switching node** in the mesh. It is the fundamental routing unit of the ARP fabric. A Room:

- Accepts ASP connections from agent sidecars, humans, client bridges, and peer Rooms
- Maintains a local routing table pushed by the Control Plane
- Forwards messages to local participants or to peer Rooms
- Broadcasts messages within a workspace according to fan-out rules
- Persists messages to an append-only audit log
- Is itself an ASP participant — it can join other Rooms as a peer

This last property is the key architectural insight: **Room-to-Room communication uses the same ASP protocol as any other participant connection**. There is no separate inter-Room protocol. A Room joins another Room exactly as any external participant would, enabling recursive composition.

### 2.3 Workspace

A Workspace is the primary user-facing abstraction in ARP. It is a **managed collaboration unit** that bundles:

- **A Room** — the underlying switching node
- **An Environment Resource Service** — an abstract provider of context, environment resources, and workspace information
- **Agents** — one or more, each with a harness and model configuration
- **Members** — humans with roles (owner, admin, member) and permissions
- **Channels** — bindings to external systems (Telegram threads, Slack channels, etc.) via client bridges
- **Audit log** — append-only record of all messages, approvals, and operations

A Workspace has a hierarchical identifier: `{namespace}/{name}` (e.g., `myns/myproject`). Workspaces are managed by the Control Plane and have a defined lifecycle: `creating → running → suspended → running → terminated`.

The relationship between Workspace and Room: a Workspace always has exactly one Room. The Room handles switching; the Workspace provides identity, state, and lifecycle. Multiple Workspaces may run on the same physical infrastructure but their Rooms are logically isolated. This RFC intentionally keeps the environment model abstract; concrete resource schemas are left to a separate companion Environment/Resource RFC.

### 2.4 Client Bridge

A Client Bridge is an ASP participant that translates between an external protocol and ASP. From the Room's perspective, a bridge is just another participant — the Room does not know or care that it is backed by Telegram, Slack, or any other system.

Examples:

| Bridge | External Protocol | ASP Role |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram Bridge | Telegram Bot API (thread-bound) | `bridge` |
| Slack Bridge | Slack Events API (channel-bound) | `bridge` |
| CLI Client | Native ASP over WebSocket | `human` (direct, no bridge needed) |
| IDE / File Mount | FUSE + ASP sidecar | `bridge` |

A bridge registers with the Room using role `bridge` and declares metadata about the external channel it represents. Messages flowing through a bridge carry the original author's identity, not the bridge's.

### 2.5 Control Plane

The Control Plane is a Raft-replicated cluster responsible for:

- **Workspace lifecycle** — create, suspend, resume, terminate workspaces
- **Topology management** — tracking all Rooms, agents, bridges, and inter-Room links
- **Routing state distribution** — pushing routing tables to Rooms via xDS-style streaming
- **Agent lifecycle** — managing spawn/terminate of agents and their attached sidecars via the Runtime Lifecycle Manager
- **Membership and authorization** — enforcing workspace-local roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`) and optional opaque IAM payloads on sessions and mandates
- **Cluster federation** — managing inter-cluster links for mesh-of-meshes

The Control Plane is **not** in the data path. It configures routing state, but message forwarding happens directly between Rooms. If the Control Plane becomes temporarily unavailable, Rooms continue forwarding using their last known routing state — providing **fault tolerance by design**. Base authorization in ARP is workspace-local; deployments may attach opaque IAM payloads to sessions and mandates for policy enrichment, but this RFC does not standardize their schema. Direct resource targeting is restricted to `owner` and `admin` members in base ARP and is proxied by the Room to the Environment/Resource service.

### 2.6 Runtime Lifecycle Manager (RLM)

An abstraction over execution environments (Kubernetes, native-fork, serverless, etc.) that the Control Plane uses to:

- Spawn and terminate agents and their attached sidecars (with harness configuration)
- Provision and destroy environment resources
- Suspend and resume environment/resource handles

The RLM is pluggable — the protocol is agnostic to the underlying runtime. The RLM connects to Rooms as an ASP participant with role `rlm`.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Layered Model

ARP defines three planes:

| Plane | Components | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration Plane** | Control Plane (Raft) | k8s API Server + etcd |
| **Switching Fabric** | Rooms + ASP relay + Bridges | kube-proxy + CNI |
| **Runtime Plane** | RLM (k8s, fork, etc.) + Agents + Sidecars + Environment Resources | kubelet + container runtime |

### 3.2 Workspace Topology (Single Workspace)

A typical workspace with CLI, Telegram, and a single agent:

```
                     [Control Plane]
                          |
                    manage lifecycle
                          |
 [CLI] ── ASP ──→ [  Room  ] ←── ASP ── [Telegram Bridge]
                      ↑   ↑                |
                      |   |                |
                      |   +──── ASP ── [File Mount Bridge]
                      |                     |
                      |               [FUSE → ~/relay/ns/proj]
                      |
                   ASP via
                 attached sidecar
                      |
               [Sidecar: claude]
                      |
             invoke / poll locally
                      |
                [Agent: claude]
```

All external Room edges in this example are ASP sessions. The agent process is not. The Room talks to the agent through its attached sidecar, and the sidecar invokes or polls the local agent. When the agent produces a reply, the sidecar emits the corresponding ASP message and the Room fans it out to CLI and both bridges. When a human types in the Telegram thread, the bridge forwards it as an ASP message attributed to that human; if the message has no explicit agent target, the Room stores it as a `room_message`.

### 3.3 Multi-Room Topology

Across multiple workspaces and Rooms, the mesh topology is a **configuration**, not code. The Control Plane defines which Rooms connect to which. Any topology can be expressed: hub-and-spoke, tree, ring, full mesh, or hierarchical.

```
[Control Plane (Raft cluster)]
         |
   push routing tables
         |
   +------+------+
   |             |
[Room A]      [Room B]
  ws: myns/    ws: myns/
  myproject    infra
  |    \      /    |
[ag1] [ag2]-[ag3] [ag4]
```

### 3.4 Routing Table Distribution (xDS Model)

When an agent is spawned in Room B, the Control Plane:

1. Updates global state (Raft-committed)
2. Streams routing table update to all affected Rooms via persistent gRPC/WebSocket
3. Rooms update their local forwarding table atomically

Rooms forward messages autonomously using their local table. If the Control Plane becomes temporarily unavailable, Rooms continue forwarding with their last known state.

---

## 4. ARP Session Protocol (ASP)

### 4.1 Design Principles

ASP is ARP's native session protocol. It is a bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol that runs over gRPC, WebSocket, or raw TCP. ASP is purpose-built for Room-based switching with:

- **Connection initialization** with capability negotiation
- **Session multiplexing** — multiple logical sessions over one connection
- **Envelope-based messaging** with source/destination addressing
- **Broadcast and fan-out** — addressing groups of participants by role
- **Streaming notifications** for routing table updates and session events
- **Heartbeat and liveness** detection

ASP borrows design principles from ACP (JSON-RPC 2.0, capability negotiation, streaming updates) and A2A (HTTP/gRPC transport, structured task messages), but is purpose-built for relay semantics. Neither ACP nor A2A support multi-hop forwarding, routing tables, or Room-based switching.

This document provides the architectural and behavioral model for ASP. The normative method catalog, error codes, and wire schemas are intended to live in a separate companion ASP RFC.

### 4.2 Connection Lifecycle

```
Participant                          Room
    |                                  |
    |─── asp/initialize ─────────────→|
    |    { protocol_version,           |
    |      role,                       |
    |      participant_info,           |
    |      capabilities,               |
    |      workspace }                 |
    |                                  |
    |←── initialize_response ─────────|
    |    { room_info,                  |
    |      capabilities,               |
    |      members,                    |
    |      routing_snapshot }          |
    |                                  |
    |─── asp/ready ──────────────────→|
    |                                  |
    |⇐⇒  Bidirectional messaging  ⇐⇒ |
```

The `role` field indicates participant type:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent` | Logical AI agent represented by an attached sidecar |
| `human` | Human user (direct CLI/WebSocket connection) |
| `bridge` | Client bridge translating an external protocol |
| `room` | Peer Room (inter-Room link) |
| `rlm` | Runtime Lifecycle Manager |

Rooms treat all roles uniformly for message forwarding. The role is metadata for fan-out rules, observability, and authorization policy — not routing. The attached sidecar is modeled as an internal child session, but the Room projects it as the parent logical `agent` participant. Because every agent is sidecar-backed in ARP v1, transport-mode negotiation is not required in ASP session setup.

### 4.3 Message Envelope

All messages routed through ARP use a common envelope:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "asp/message",
  "params": {
    "id": "msg-uuid-001",
    "from": "itbaron",
    "to": "claude",
    "type": "text",
    "ttl": 8,
    "payload": {
      "text": "add zod schemas for all endpoints"
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Unique message identifier (UUID) |
| `correlation_id` | correlated flows only | Shared identifier linking related request, chunk, result, end, and approval messages |
| `from` | yes | Sender identity (agent name, human username, bridge ID) |
| `to` | except `room_message` | Destination: local agent name, `arp://namespace/workspace/agent`, `resource://namespace/workspace/resource`, `*` for broadcast, or `role:...` for role-based fan-out |
| `source_workspace` | cross-workspace only | Source workspace identifier (`namespace/name`) |
| `destination_workspace` | cross-workspace only | Destination workspace identifier (`namespace/name`) |
| `mandate` | delegated sidecar and direct resource requests | Inline signed claim object issued and signed by the current Room for local enforcement, always including an expiry |
| `type` | yes | Message type (see §4.4) |
| `ttl` | yes | Time-to-live, decremented at each Room hop. Dropped at 0. |
| `payload` | yes | Opaque to ARP. Application-level content. |

For same-workspace traffic bound to a single session workspace, `source_workspace` and `destination_workspace` MAY be omitted. When omitted, the Room resolves both values from the session workspace context. For cross-workspace traffic, both fields MUST be present. ASP field names shown in this RFC use `snake_case`. At minimum, a signed `mandate` binds the subject, workspace, resource scope, and expiry, where scope is either an explicit resource set or `*` for all resources in scope. Related `resource_call`, `resource_chunk`, `resource_result`, `resource_end`, and approval messages reuse the same `correlation_id`.

### 4.4 Message Types

| Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | any → any | Targeted plain text or markdown message |
| `room_message` | human/bridge → room | Untargeted human message appended to room history and not delivered to agents |
| `resource_call` | human/agent → room | Direct resource request routed by the Room to the Environment/Resource service |
| `resource_result` | room → requester | Final or single response for a direct resource request |
| `resource_chunk` | room → requester | Streaming chunk for a direct resource request when workspace policy enables streaming |
| `resource_end` | room → requester | Explicit end-of-stream marker for a streamed direct resource request |
| `approval_request` | agent/room → role:human | Request for human approval with risk level and action description |
| `approval_response` | human → agent/room | Approve or deny, with approver identity |
| `delivery_failure` | room → original sender | Explicit notice that delivery or forwarding failed |
| `session_event` | room → all | Participant joined, left, or changed status |
| `routing_update` | cp → room | Routing table push (Control Plane to Room only) |

The `payload` field carries type-specific content. ARP routes all types identically — the type field exists for client rendering and policy enforcement, not for routing decisions. ARP does not define low-level agent execution contracts such as tool invocation or tool result messages. For `resource_call`, the Room acts as a policy-enforcing proxy to the Environment/Resource service.

### 4.5 Broadcast and Fan-out

A Room implements the following fan-out rules:

- **`to: "agent-name"`** — deliver to the named participant within the local workspace
- **`to: "arp://namespace/workspace/agent"`** — deliver to the canonical remote participant identified by ARP URI
- **`to: "resource://namespace/workspace/resource"`** — route a direct resource request through the Room to the Environment/Resource service
- **`to: "*"`** — deliver to all participants in the workspace
- **`to: "role:human"`** — deliver to all participants with role `human` or `bridge` (bridges represent human channels)
- **`to: "role:agent"`** — deliver to all participants with role `agent`

Default behavior: when an agent sends a `text` message without an explicit `to`, the Room defaults to `role:human` — the message fans out to all human participants and bridges. This is how a single agent response appears in both CLI and Telegram simultaneously.

When a human or bridge sends a message without an explicit agent target, the Room stores it as a `room_message` in room history and does not route it to agents. Human-to-agent delivery happens only through explicit delegation.

The `role:agent` form is available for explicit system-level fan-out, but human delegation in multi-agent workspaces targets a specific agent URI rather than an agent broadcast.

Direct resource targeting uses `resource://namespace/workspace/resource` URIs. For human participants it is available only to `owner` and `admin` members in base ARP. Agents may also target `resource://` URIs through normal ASP messages.

### 4.6 Delegation

Delegation is not a separate ASP primitive. A client or bridge delegates by sending a normal `text` message whose `to` field is a specific ARP agent URI such as `arp://myns/myproject/claude`.

Delegation carries only the selected message content, not an implicit reference to prior room history. Delegation targets a single agent, and the base workspace default is that any member may delegate unless the workspace policy overrides it.

When a human delegates to a workspace-managed sidecar agent, the Room always attaches an inline signed `mandate` claim that captures the authorized scope for that request. The issuing Room signs the mandate, enforces authorization before issuing it, and the attached sidecar verifies the mandate for local enforcement when invoking the passive agent.

In base ARP v1, mandated delegation targets are workspace-managed sidecar agents.

If an agent or sidecar forwards or re-delegates work, the current Room must mint and sign a reduced-scope mandate rather than reusing the original mandate unchanged.

### 4.7 Direct Resource Access

Direct resource access is represented as `resource_call` addressed to a `resource://namespace/workspace/resource` URI. For human callers, the Room verifies that the sender is an `owner` or `admin`. For agent callers, the Room evaluates the request against the agent's current mandate and workspace policy. The Room always attaches or propagates a signed mandate, evaluates the separate `resource_approval_policy`, and proxies the request to the Environment/Resource service. The Environment/Resource service verifies the mandate again before execution. Mutating resource operations use the existing `approval_request` / `approval_response` message pair. The service response returns to the requester either as a single `resource_result` or as a stream of `resource_chunk` messages terminated by `resource_end`, depending on workspace configuration.

Mandate expiry is checked when the `resource_call` is admitted. Once a long-running streamed request has started successfully, it is allowed to finish even if the original mandate would expire during the stream.

Cross-workspace `resource_call` is not generally routable in base ARP. It is allowed only across trusted federated links.

### 4.8 Delivery Failure

If a Room cannot route or deliver a message because of missing routes, insufficient link trust claims, queue exhaustion, or TTL expiry, it emits a `delivery_failure` message back to the original sender or upstream Room.

### 4.9 Approval Flow

Operations that require human approval follow a structured flow routed through the Room:

```
Agent                    Room                    Humans
  |                        |                        |
  |─ approval_request ───→|                        |
  |  { action: "mutating  |─ fan-out to ──────────→|
  |    resource access",  |  role:human             |
  |    risk: "high" }     |                        |
  |                        |                        |
  |                        |←── approval_response ──|
  |                        |    { approved: true,    |
  |←── approval_response ──|      approver: "itbaron" }
  |    (routed back)       |                        |
```

The Room enforces workspace-level approval policy:

- **Who can approve** — based on member roles (owner, admin)
- **What requires approval** — based on risk classification
- **How many approvals** — single approver or quorum (configurable per workspace)

The approval policy is workspace metadata managed by the Control Plane. The Room enforces it; the agent proposes operations without knowledge of the policy.

Any follow-up execution or completion reporting happens through normal ARP messages such as `text` or `resource_result`, or through implementation-specific agent-local contracts outside ARP.

For cross-workspace operations in v1, approval is governed by the **source workspace** policy. The destination Room trusts the forwarded approval decision if the inter-Room link negotiated the required trust claim during connection setup.

### 5.2 Create

Creating a workspace requires an identity, an initial membership set, an agent harness/model selection, and any initial environment or context inputs required by the deployment.

The Control Plane:

1. Allocates workspace identity `myns/myproject`
2. Instructs the RLM to provision environment resources and context handles
3. Spawns a Room for the workspace
4. Instructs the RLM to spawn the agent with the specified harness and model, together with its attached sidecar
5. Registers the creator as `owner`
6. Updates routing tables

### 5.3 Suspend and Resume

Suspending a workspace preserves the control-plane snapshot and the environment/resource handles but releases live compute resources. The Room is terminated and the agent process is stopped.

Resuming restores the environment/resource handles, spawns a new Room, reconnects the agent as a new session, and re-establishes channel bindings. The agent cold-starts; live session migration and audit-log replay are not part of the v1 recovery model.

The new session is established by the attached sidecar, not by the agent process directly.

### 5.4 Channels

A workspace can have multiple channel bindings, each backed by a client bridge. A binding records the external protocol, bridge instance, and an opaque external resource reference such as a thread, channel, or room identifier.

The Control Plane:

1. Registers the channel binding metadata
2. Spawns or configures a Telegram Bridge process
3. The bridge opens an ASP session to the workspace's Room
4. Messages in the Telegram thread flow bidirectionally through the bridge

A workspace can have multiple channels simultaneously. Each channel binding maps a specific external resource (thread, channel, room) to the workspace. The binding is 1:1 — one external thread maps to exactly one workspace.

## 6. Control Plane State Model

The Control Plane maintains the following state (Raft-replicated):

```yaml
cluster:
  name: example-mesh
  endpoint: mesh.example

workspaces:
  myns/myproject:
    status: running
    room: room-7a3f
    environment:
      service: ers-01
      status: ready
      handles:
        - { kind: repo, ref: resource://myns/myproject/repo }
        - { kind: workspace_root, ref: resource://myns/myproject/root }
        - { kind: context, ref: resource://myns/myproject/context }
    agents:
      claude:
        harness: claude
        model: opus-4.5
        status: active
        capabilities: [code, test, deploy]
        transport:
          mode: sidecar
          protocol: acp
          visibility: hidden
    members:
      itbaron:
        role: owner
        joined: "2026-03-08T14:00:00Z"
        iam_session: opaque://iam/itbaron
      it-baron:
        role: admin
        joined: "2026-03-08T14:10:00Z"
    channels:
      telegram:
        bridge: telegram-bridge-01
        external_ref: opaque://telegram/thread/12345
        status: connected
    approval_policy:
      risk_low: auto
      risk_medium: any_admin
      risk_high: any_admin
      risk_critical: owner
    resource_approval_policy:
      read: auto
      mutate: any_admin_or_owner
    resource_policy:
      direct_targeting: admins_and_owners
      result_mode: single_or_stream
      stream_terminator: resource_end
    delegation_policy:
      default: any_member

rooms:
  room-7a3f:
    endpoint: "10.0.0.1:7000"
    workspace: myns/myproject
    status: healthy
    participants:
      - { name: claude, role: agent }
      - { name: itbaron, role: human }
      - { name: it-baron, role: human, via: telegram }
      - { name: telegram-bridge-01, role: bridge }

routes:
  room-7a3f:
    claude: local
    itbaron: local
    it-baron: local (via telegram-bridge-01)

links: {}
```

For multi-workspace meshes, the state extends with inter-Room links and cross-workspace routing:

```yaml
rooms:
  room-7a3f:
    workspace: myns/myproject
  room-9b2c:
    workspace: myns/infra

links:
  room-7a3f <-> room-9b2c:
    status: established
    trust_claims: [forward_messages, forward_approvals, forward_mandates]

routes:
  room-7a3f:
    claude: local
    arp://myns/infra/infra-agent: via room-9b2c
  room-9b2c:
    infra-agent: local
    arp://myns/myproject/claude: via room-7a3f
```

---

## 7. Agent Addressing

Agents and participants are addressed either by local logical name or by canonical ARP URI. Resolution is handled by the Room using its local routing table.

### 7.1 Addressing Schemes

| Form | Example | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Local** | `claude` | Resolved only within the local workspace |
| **ARP URI** | `arp://myns/infra/infra-agent` | Route to a specific agent in a specific workspace |
| **Resource URI** | `resource://myns/myproject/root` | Route a direct resource request through the Room to the Environment/Resource service |
| **Role-based** | `role:human` | Fan-out to all participants matching the role |
| **Broadcast** | `*` | Fan-out to all participants in the workspace |

Agents may use local names only for same-workspace delivery. Cross-workspace delivery uses canonical ARP URIs. Direct resource access uses `resource://` URIs. Role-based and broadcast addressing are used for fan-out within a workspace.

### 7.2 Cross-Workspace Addressing

When agent `claude` in `myns/myproject` needs to reach `infra-agent` in `myns/infra`:

1. Claude sends: `{ to: "arp://myns/infra/infra-agent", payload: ... }`
2. Room A looks up routing table: `arp://myns/infra/infra-agent → via room-9b2c`
3. Room A forwards via its ASP session with Room B
4. Room B delivers locally to `infra-agent`

The Control Plane pre-provisions remote routes keyed by canonical ARP URI. Rooms do not perform implicit cross-workspace resolution from simple names.

---

## 8. Audit Log

Every Room writes messages to an append-only audit log persisted by the Control Plane. The log captures:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | Message receipt time |
| `source_workspace` | Source workspace identifier |
| `destination_workspace` | Destination workspace identifier |
| `from` | Sender identity |
| `to` | Destination (including fan-out targets) |
| `mandate_hash` | Hash of mandate payload, if present |
| `type` | Message type |
| `payload_hash` | Hash of payload (or full payload, configurable) |
| `approval` | Approver identity and decision, if applicable |

An implementation may expose the audit log through a CLI, API, or UI. An illustrative excerpt:

```
14:01  itbaron    "review the current architecture"
14:02  claude     "summarized the topology and open questions"
14:05  itbaron    "prepare an update for the validation rules"
14:09  claude     "draft update ready for review"
14:15  it-baron   "connect a Telegram channel to this workspace"
14:16  system     session_event telegram-bridge-01 joined
14:30  claude     approval_request "mutating resource access"
14:31  it-baron   approval_response approved
15:10  itbaron    "delegate follow-up work to infra-agent"
15:11  room       delivery_failure route unavailable
```

The audit log persists across suspend and resume for human review, debugging, and tooling. It is not the protocol-defined recovery mechanism for agent state in v1.

---

## 9. Room-to-Room Communication

### 9.1 Rooms as ASP Participants

The defining property of ARP is that **a Room is an ASP participant**. Room B joins Room A exactly as any other participant would. From Room A's perspective, there is no difference between a human user, a peer Room, or the RLM; all are participants with ASP sessions. An agent reaches the Room through its attached sidecar but is represented to the Room as the logical `agent` participant. This unification eliminates the need for a separate inter-Room protocol and enables recursive composition.

### 9.2 Message Forwarding Flow

When `claude` in Room A sends a message to `infra-agent` in Room B:

```
1. claude sends:    { to: "arp://myns/infra/infra-agent", payload: ... }
2. Room A looks up local routing table
3. Table says:      arp://myns/infra/infra-agent → Room B
4. Room A forwards via its ASP session with Room B:
   { from: "claude", to: "arp://myns/infra/infra-agent",
     source_workspace: "myns/myproject",
     destination_workspace: "myns/infra",
     room_src: "room-7a3f", ttl: 7, payload: ... }
5. Room B receives and delivers to infra-agent's attached sidecar as a local ASP message
```

The envelope carries `room_src` for traceability. Agents interact only with their local Room via standard ASP.

### 9.3 Inter-Room Link Lifecycle

Inter-Room links are provisioned by the Control Plane **before** traffic flows (pre-provisioned routing). The Control Plane:

1. Determines required Room-to-Room links based on agent placement
2. Instructs Room B to open an ASP session to Room A
3. During session initialization, the Rooms negotiate accepted per-capability trust claims
4. Pushes routing entries to both Rooms
5. Monitors link health and re-provisions on failure

Forwarded approval decisions, mandate propagation, and other trust-sensitive operations are honored only when the inter-Room link negotiated the corresponding trust claim. Rooms verify signed mandates before forwarding or proxying, and receiving execution endpoints verify them again before acting.

When delegation crosses Room boundaries, the current forwarding Room must issue any new mandate using reduced scope relative to the upstream request context.

Cross-workspace `resource_call` follows a stricter rule: it is allowed only across trusted federated links and remains governed by the destination workspace's `resource_approval_policy`.

---

## 10. Mesh of Meshes (Federation)

Because Rooms are ASP participants, the same model extends to federation across clusters and organizations.

### 10.1 Intra-Organization Federation

Multiple clusters within the same organization are federated by linking boundary Rooms. The Control Planes remain independent; only the boundary Rooms are bridged.

```
[Cluster: example-mesh]           [Cluster: personal]
  [CP-A]                            [CP-B]
    |                                  |
  [Room A1] ←── ASP ──→ [Room B1]  [Room B2]
    ag1  ag2               ag3     ag4  ag5
```

### 10.2 Cross-Organization Federation via A2A

For cross-organization federation where the peer may not run ARP, boundary Rooms can expose A2A-compatible endpoints. The Room acts as a reverse proxy, translating between A2A HTTP discovery / task management and ASP:

```
External A2A Client
    |
    |── GET /.well-known/agent.json ──→  Boundary Room
    |                                      |
    |←── Agent Card (proxied) ─────────────|
    |                                      |
    |── POST /tasks (A2A) ───────────────→ Boundary Room
    |                                      |
    |                           Wraps in ASP envelope, routes internally
    |                                      |
    |←── A2A Response (proxied) ───────────|
```

This allows ARP-hosted agents to participate in the broader A2A ecosystem without requiring external systems to adopt ARP.

This section is informative only. It does not define a normative interoperability profile.

## 11. Relationship to Kubernetes

ARP is intentionally analogous to Kubernetes but for agent communication rather than container orchestration:

| Kubernetes | ARP | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|
| Namespace | Namespace | Identical concept |
| Deployment | Workspace | Workspace includes environment, members, channels |
| Pod | Agent | Agent has session state, harness, model config |
| Node | Room | Room is an active message forwarder, not a passive host |
| etcd (Raft) | CP state (Raft) | Identical model |
| kube-proxy | Room routing table | Room routes ASP envelopes, not TCP packets |
| CNI | Inter-Room ASP | Fabric is semantic (JSON-RPC), not network-layer |
| kubelet | RLM | RLM is pluggable (k8s, fork, serverless) |
| NetworkPolicy | Approval policy | Policy enforced per-workspace with human-in-the-loop |

The critical difference: Kubernetes delegates networking to CNI and treats it as transparent infrastructure. ARP treats the **communication fabric as the primary primitive**. The network is not transparent — it is the product.

---

## 12. Relationship to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)

The AAIF, launched in December 2025 under the Linux Foundation by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI (with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, and others), provides neutral governance for foundational agentic AI projects including MCP, goose, and AGENTS.md. Google's A2A protocol is separately governed under the Linux Foundation.

ARP is designed to be **compatible with and complementary to** these protocols:

- **MCP:** Agents within an ARP workspace freely use MCP to access tools and data. The Room does not interfere with MCP connections. An MCP server can be co-located with the workspace environment for shared tool access.
- **A2A:** Boundary Rooms expose A2A-compatible endpoints for interoperability. A2A messages between mesh-hosted agents are transparently relayed through the ARP fabric.
- **AGENTS.md:** Agent configuration (including AGENTS.md conventions) is orthogonal to ARP. The RLM may use AGENTS.md to configure spawned agents.
- **ACP:** Agents that are ACP-compatible coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI) can be spawned inside a workspace and connected to an editor via an ACP bridge. The bridge translates ACP's stdio JSON-RPC into ASP sessions.

ARP does not seek to replace any of these protocols. It provides the managed infrastructure mesh beneath them.

---

## 13. Open Questions

The following topics require further specification:

- **Companion ASP RFC:** The separate ASP specification still needs the full JSON-RPC method catalog, error codes, schemas, and negotiation details.
- **IAM payload schema:** Optional IAM enrichment on sessions and mandates is supported conceptually, but the payload schema and propagation rules are intentionally unspecified.
- **Trust claim registry:** ARP starts with `forward_messages`, `forward_approvals`, and `forward_mandates`, but it still needs a standard registry and negotiation semantics for future claims.
- **Companion Environment/Resource RFC:** The separate environment/resource specification still needs the concrete `resource_call`, `resource_chunk`, and `resource_result` payload schemas, `resource_approval_policy` schema, lifecycle semantics, and required metadata.
- **Delegation policy overrides:** Base ARP defaults delegation to any member, but the workspace-level override schema is still open.
- **Capability-based routing extension:** Capability multicast is deferred to a future optional extension and is not part of base ARP.

---

## 14. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** part of this RFC:

- Agent business logic or task delegation protocols (use A2A)
- Agent-to-tool integration (use MCP)
- Editor-to-agent integration (use ACP)
- Specific ASP message payload formats beyond the envelope
- Agent harness specification (opaque to the protocol)
- Live agent session migration between Rooms
- Protocol-standardized observability and tracing semantics
- UI/UX for approval buttons, message rendering, or thread display
- Billing, metering, or quota management
